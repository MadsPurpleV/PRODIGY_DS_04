# Task-4: Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data

## Project Description
Analyzed the Titanic dataset by cleaning missing values and exploring key features. Conducted EDA to identify trends and relationships affecting passenger survival, and presented findings through clear visualizations for better interpretation.

This project analyzes social media posts to understand public opinion and attitudes toward a given topic.

It is part of my **Prodigy Internship Data Science - Task 4**.

## Insights
- Most passengers were in 3rd class.
- Survival rate was higher for females than males.
- Younger passengers had slightly higher survival rate.
- Fare and class are positively correlated (higher class, higher fare).
